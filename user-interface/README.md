# Introduction
This project contains basic html and css. Buttons in the html linked to a websocket function written in javascript makes it possible to communicate with a micro-computer on the other side which is designed to control a robot.

Besides the controls there's an iframe included to an opensource video-calling api to have virtual meetings. The meeting-room can be accessed by visiting: `https://deltec.daily.co/hello`

# Running the project
Simply open index.html in a browser to have it run locally.

Ideally, though, it would be ran on a server.
